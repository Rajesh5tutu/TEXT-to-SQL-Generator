## Future Advancements
To further elevate the capabilities of SQL Genie, the following enhancements are planned:
- LLM Integration via LangChain
Incorporate LangChain to enable more advanced natural language understanding, multi-step reasoning, and contextual memory.

This will allow the app to:
- Handle follow-up questions and conversational SQL refinement
- Support multiple database schemas dynamically
- Chain prompts and tools for richer query generation and validation

Multi-Database Support
  - Extend compatibility beyond SQLite to include PostgreSQL, MySQL, and cloud-hosted databases.
    
Custom Prompt Templates
  - Allow users to define their own prompt structure for domain-specific SQL generation.
    
User Session Memory
  - Persist user interactions to enable context-aware query suggestions and history tracking.
    
Role-Based Access & Query Logging
  - Add user authentication and query logging for enterprise-grade usage and auditability.
    
Deployment as a SaaS Tool
  - Package the app for cloud deployment with user onboarding, API access, and billing support.
